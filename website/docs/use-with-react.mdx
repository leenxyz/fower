Fower is great fit for React-like framework or library, Let's get started with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Installation

```bash
npm i @fower/react
```

## Usage with Box component

Now we're going to build a user profile card ui with `Box` component:

```tsx
import { Box } from '@fower/react'
```

```jsx live
<Box bgGray100 p6>
  <Box toCenterY p-10 w-260 bgWhite rounded-10 shadowMD>
    <Box as="img" circle-48 src="/img/jobs.jpg" />
    <Box ml-10>
      <Box textXL fontBold>
        Steve Jobs
      </Box>
      <Box gray800>Co-founder of Apple Inc.</Box>
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Box>
```

As you can see, we can build a more complex interface with few code. At first glance, you might say: "Isn't this a disguised inline style?" This is indeed similar to the inline style. They both write the style on JSX, but maybe this is the only similarity of them. The way to writing styles of Fower, I call it "Atomic props".

Compared with inline style, "Atomic props" has many advantages:

- **Less Code**, inline styles has a larger amount of code, which can easily make JSX messy, but "Atomic props" retains the simplicity of JSX and is more readable.

- **Style reuse**, using inline styles, it is easy to quickly expand the code, using "Atomic props", the code size will not expand too much as the project grows.

## Use in HTML elements

Atomic Props can also be used directly in html elements. In other words, you can directly add Atomic Props to html tags, the code is similar to the following:

```jsx
<div p6 textXL bgRed200>
  Use fower in HTML tag
</div>
```

To use Atomic Props in html elements, you should add a babel preset `@fower/babel-preset-fower` to the project by configuring babel.

```json title=".babelrc"
{
  "presets": ["@fower/babel-preset-fower"]
}
```

Then, you can use Atomic Props in HTML elements:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export default () => {
  return (
    <div p6 textXL bgRed200>
      Use fower with Babel Preset
    </div>
  )
}
```

Note that if you want to get TypeScript type hints, you need to extend the attribute types of HTML by creating a new `d.ts` file in the project root directory, you can name it `index.d.ts`, the code is as follows:

```jsx title="index.d.ts"
import { AtomicProps } from '@fower/types';

declare module 'react' {
  interface HTMLAttributes<T> extends AtomicProps {}
}

```
